"\e[1;5C": forward-word
"\e[1;5D": backward-word
# urxvt
"\eOc": forward-word
"\eOd": backward-word

### ctrl+delete
"\e[3;5~": kill-word
# in this case, st misbehaves (even with tmux)
"\e[M": kill-word
# and of course, urxvt must be always special
"\e[3^": kill-word

### ctrl+backspace

### ctrl+shift+delete
"\e[3;6~": kill-line
# URxvt note: you have to disable Ctrl+Shift popup in ~/.Xresources:
# URxvt.iso14755: true
# URxvt.iso14755_52: false
"\e[3@": kill-line
# st sends same sequence as plain delete :(
